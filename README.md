🧠 How It Works
The Redux store holds the global cart state.

CartSlice defines add and remove reducers.

Products are fetched from Fake Store API.

Each product can be added or removed from the cart.

A real-time total amount and cart count are shown in the UI.

Toast messages notify users about actions like adding/removing items.
